# Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.
# A dictionary is a collection which is ordered, changeable and does not allow duplicates.
# In Python, dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and they have keys and values.

# Example 1: Creating a dictionary
myDict = {"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
print(myDict)  # Output: {'name': 'John', 'age':30, 'city': 'New York'}
