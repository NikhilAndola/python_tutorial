# for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string) or other iterable objects.
# It is used to execute a block of code repeatedly for a fixed number of times.
# Example 1: Iterating over a list

# fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# for fruit in fruits:
#     print(fruit)
#     for str in fruit:
#         print(str)

for i in range(5):
    print(i)

for i in range(1, 10):
    print(i)

for i in range(5, 15, 2):
    print(i)
